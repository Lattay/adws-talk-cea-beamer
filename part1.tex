  The \texttt{paral\_kgb} mode imply:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Parallelization over $k$ vectors, which is trivial because
    they are always orthogonal.
  \end{itemize}

  And depending on the context one of:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Parallelization over \emph{plane waves} ($g$)
    \item Parallelization over \emph{bands} ($b$)
  \end{itemize}
  Also in some cases there is locally parallelization over atoms, PAW projectors...
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Computation of the density in DFT}
  \begin{equation}
    n(\vec{r}) = \sum_{i \in \text{bands}} d_i~\phi_i(\vec{r})^* \phi_i(\vec{r})
    \label{eq:dft_density}
  \end{equation}

  The density have is easily done in real space with a few bands on each CPU.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Before \texttt{mkrho}, diagonalization of the hamiltonian \Rightarrow
      representation in reciprocal space and plane waves components distributed (for linear algebra, named \emph{linalg} layout).
    \item Transposition of coefficients (gather plane waves, distribute bands, layout called \emph{fft}) 
    \item Inverse Fourier transform (change the representation from reciprocal space to real space)
    \item Density efficiently computed in real space with a natural parallelization
      over bands 
  \end{enumerate}
  
%  \alert{}

% As the density is computed by making product of vectors in the real space,
% it would imply a convolution product in reciprocal space.
% As a consequence we do not have plane waves at the time we compute the density.
% Also the natural parallelization is over the band. In the classic DFT case it
% is straitforward since we simply split the sum between CPUs.\\
% In our case it is no longer simple since we need arbitrary pairs of bands on
% each CPUs.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Parallelization for the computation of the density (PAW part)}
  In PAW part:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item no plane waves by definition
    \item few components in the PAW base
  \end{itemize}
  Then band parallelization is the default. Bands are distributed among CPUs.
