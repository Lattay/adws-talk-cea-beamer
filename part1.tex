  \begin{itemize}
    \item Dynamic Mean Field Theory (DMFT): one of the theory developed
  to address the problem of correlated electrons in transition metals 
  and lanthanides
    \item deals with non-local density and is totally different from the DFT
  \end{itemize}
  How to integrate it with \textsc{Abinit} ?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Define non-diagonal occupations of the Kohn-Sham vectors from the DFT
    \item Compute the density from these occupations and the Kohn-Sham vectors
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{From DFT density to DMFT+DFT density}
  Density expressed in terms of Kohn-Sham vectors and occupations:
  \begin{equation}
    n(\vec{r}) = \sum_{i \in \text{bands}} d_i~\phi_i(\vec{r})^* \phi_i(\vec{r})
  \end{equation}

  With non-diagonals occupations

  \begin{equation}
    n(\vec{r}) = \sum_{i, i' \in \text{bands}} d_{i,i'}~\phi_{i'}(\vec{r})^* \phi_i(\vec{r})
  \end{equation}
  \alert{We have now to compute products of vectors from different bands}
